  https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html
- Create self-signed certificate 
  https://github.com/infotechinc/create-x509-certificate
- Image
  - Base64 to image (although you can just use the browser's address bar for that)
  - Add "browse" option (after the image was loaded)
- Charmap
  - By categories
  - Search
- Data
  - Choosing an action from the list should prefill the add form
  - Use RAF to do calculation? (setup a load test)
  - Import / Export
